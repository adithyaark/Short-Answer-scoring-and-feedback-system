# Short-Answer-scoring-and-feedback-system
Our user-friendly web app saves educators time by automating short answer grading. Users input responses, and the system uses a machine learning model to compare student answers with reference answers. The backend extracts key features, ensuring consistent grading and immediate feedback.

The methodology used in the "Intelligent Short Answer Scoring And Feedback
System" involves creating a lexical representation using TF-IDF, and a semantic
representation using BERT Cross Encoder. These representations are integrated
to form a comprehensive feature vector, which is then input into a Random
Forest Regressor to predict student scores. Feedback is generated by extracting
and comparing keywords from the reference and student answers, identifying
gaps, and providing suggestions for improvement. This approach leverages
advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to automate grading, ensuring
efficient, accurate, and insightfulfeedback for students .
